Functions:-

Functions are the block of code that is designed to perform a particular task and written for the purpose of reusability and separation of logic.
It can be treated as a black box that can take some inputs, perform actions, and then return some output.
Example:-
function fun(param1, param2){}
where param1, and param2 are local variables now.
fun(1, 2) - Known as Function Invocation

Example2:-
const fun = (a, b) => {
let c = a+b;
return c;
}
fun(1, 2);
